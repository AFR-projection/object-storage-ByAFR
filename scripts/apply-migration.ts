 * Apply a single SQL migration file directly to the database.
 *
 * Why not `drizzle-kit migrate`? This DB was bootstrapped with `db:push`, so the
 * `__drizzle_migrations` table is empty. `drizzle-kit migrate` would think NOTHING
 * has been applied and try to re-run every migration from 0000 (CREATE TABLE on
 * tables that already exist -> "relation already exists"). So we apply the one
 * migration we actually need, directly. The 0002 SQL is guarded/idempotent, so
 * re-running it is safe.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/apply-migration.ts drizzle/0002_rename_email_to_phone.sql
